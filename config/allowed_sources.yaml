# Agent allowlist - Allowed Source Domains
# The agent can only scrape URLs matching these domains.
# This prevents the agent from accessing arbitrary URLs.

allowed_sources:
  # Payments sources
  - finextra.com
  - paymentweek.com
  - ecb.europa.eu
  - europeanpaymentscouncil.eu

  # Regulatory sources
  - eba.europa.eu
  - fi.se
  - bis.org
  - esma.europa.eu

# Notes:
# - Domain matching is case-insensitive
# - Subdomains are automatically included (e.g., "ecb.europa.eu" matches "www.ecb.europa.eu")
# - Add new domains here before the agent can scrape them
