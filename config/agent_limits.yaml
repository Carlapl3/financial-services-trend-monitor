# Agent Execution Limits
# These guardrails prevent runaway agent execution.

# Maximum number of ReAct loop iterations
max_steps: 6

# Maximum execution time in seconds
timeout: 90

# Notes:
# - max_steps: Agent stops after this many Thought→Action→Observation cycles
# - timeout: Wall-clock time limit for entire agent run
